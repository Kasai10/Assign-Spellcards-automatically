You need to get the Spell Cards from the repository first and put it in the folder your "DnD folder". You can specify one when first starting the programm. Be aware that i did not make these Spellcards myself. I found them on Reddit under the following link: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6fga8k/5eocart_spell_cards_for_400_spells_from_5th/
